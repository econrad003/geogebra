**Visualisations of triangle constructions using Geogebra**

1. The constructions
  + SSS - *triangle-SSS.ggb* - given three sides
  + SAS - *triangle-SAS.ggb* - given two sides and the contained angle

2. Other resources
  + There are proof-of-concept demonstration programs in my COBOL and Fortran repositories that solve these constructions in a purely algebraic manner.

  + *Warning:* It has been a long time since I've used Fortran, and I've never used Fortran extensively.  I did write COBOL extensively back in the 1970s and 1980s, but it's the first time I have ever used the CODASYL intrinsic functions extension in COBOL programming.
