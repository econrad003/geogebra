1) SIR_model.ggb - Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model using ordinary differential equations<br/>
2) SIR_modified.ggb - Same as above except some recovered individuals lose immunity<br/>
3) JacobiEllipticFunc.ggb - The Jacobian elliptic functions (sn, cn and dn) implemented as a system of ODE's<br/>
   a) these are functions of argument *u* and modulus *k* (some authors prefer to use *m=k<sup>2</sup>*)<br/>
   b) trigonometric functions: taking *k*=0 gives sn(*u*,0)=sin(*u*), cn(*u*,0)=cos(*u*) and dn(*u*,0)=1<br/>
   c) hyperbolic functions: (with *k*=1 or -1) sn(*u*,1)=tanh(*u*), cn(*u*,1)=dn(*u*,1)=sech(*u*)<br/>
   d) values of *k* between 0 and 1 (and complex values other than 0, 1 or -1) give non-elementary functions of argument *u*<br/>
